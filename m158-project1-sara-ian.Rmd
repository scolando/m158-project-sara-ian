```{r NHANES DATA}
NHANES %>%
  glimpse()
```

We are using data from the National Health and Nutrition Exam Survey (NHANES) database that was collected between 2009-2012 with adjusted weighing.

There are 75 total variables, however only 10 are relevant to our project: [list 10 we want].

The target population of NHANES is "the non-institutionalized civilian resident population of the United States". Therefore, the observational unit is a civilian resident of the United States (of any age).
